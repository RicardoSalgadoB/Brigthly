This was the code I did for hackathon, back in November. Since, I've delayade a bit in uploading it (we didn't won, so I didn't care much for the rest). Now it is finally here.

The main contents are the *Python files* in which used *Langchain* to generate the given output. There is also the data I used for the project in a PDF (IB EE preparation) and 2 CSV files coming containing webscrapped data
