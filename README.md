This was the code I did for hackathon back in November. Since, I've delayaed a bit the uploading part of it, until now.

The project is intended to showcase my use of *Langchain* for support struggling high school/university students with their academic worflows or more generally for any other task that needs an LLM. Of course this the back end, if you are curious [here's the front end](https://github.com/alibabaintelligence/brightly_pretty) say "hi" to *alibabaintelligence* on my part. Ciao.
